# collider-ng

Collider-ng: A simple, fast tool for hash collisions and exploitation, featuring a built-in hash identifier, ideal for CTFs and pentesting.


## A note on hash identification

It is impossible to mathematically and algorithmically determine which specific algorithm produced a certain hash, and that's definitely not collider-ng is claiming to be able to do. A hash of a specific length and characterset could have been generated by a number of different hashing algorithms, and the hash itself doesn't give further information for one to determine whether or not it was produced by i.e MD5 or RIPEMD128, since both of these algorithms produce 128 bit hashes.


#### TODO ???

One approach to improve the ability to differentiate between two hashing algorithms that generate hashes with similar characteristics is by considering the relative popularity of each algorithm.
